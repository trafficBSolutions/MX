# Material WorX
This repo is a MERN stacked website. Deployed on Netlify.
Consists of a server based end with Express.JS
MongoDB database, Node.JS, and the main part of this Repo is React + Vite
with HTML and CSS styling. The back-end is on a different
Repository. The server allows the forms the user
fills out to be submitted and sent emails directly back
to the MX emails and the email the user uses.
